Using LAMMPS for HiC
Guido Polles <guido.polles@gmail.com>

This is my module for performing Population Modeling from HiC data using LAMMPS.
The lammps_hic module is based on ipyparallel. The UI -if ever- will be based
on Tornado (as a web interface).
Needs:
numpy
scipy
h5py
cloudpickle
ipyparallel
tornado

pip install numpy scipy h5py cloudpickle ipyparallel tornado

or

conda install numpy scipy h5py cloudpickle ipyparallel tornado

At the moment, 4 kind of restraints are supported.
- HiC pairwise contact probabilities
- Lamin-DamID nuclear envelope contact probabilities
- FISH distance distributions
- SPRITE single cell restraints

There are example scripts/notebooks in the example folder
